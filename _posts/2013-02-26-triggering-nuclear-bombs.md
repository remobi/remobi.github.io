« And as usual I have a question for you. Wikipedia says that only the implosion method can be used to trigger a nuclear fission bomb made with plutonium. Do you know why? Why is plutonium different from uranium in this respect? ».

I have your answer, Christina. I had to research it. You’re comparing the use of the « [gun type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun-type_fission_weapon) » and the « [implosion method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_design) » technologies to trigger uranium or plutonium [nuclear bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon). That’s interesting because the answer is about the _technology_ of actually making nuclear explosions happen, not only about the _theory_ of nuclear reactions which you can find in every science textbook.

The theory of [nuclear fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission) goes: take some radioactive matter, bring enough together so that the radioactive decay of some atoms of it produce neutrons which split other atoms, producing more neutrons which split more atoms and so on in an exponential manner. This image of a chain reaction is useful to picture the split of a few atoms, but it’s not good enough to get an explosion… In other words, it’s good enough to understand how nuclear plants work (each split of an atom produces neutrons but also energy), not how nuclear bombs work.

As a matter of fact, the issue for the manufacture of bombs is that the tremendous energy produced at each split of an atom will tend to push apart and disperse the radioactive material in which the very chain reaction takes place (that’s the explosive effect – lots of energy which propagate in all directions very quickly). If you let that happen, the radioactive material is quickly dispersed in a way that doesn’t allow more atoms to be split: the chain reaction stops (the dispersion of radioactive material quickly becomes sub-critical instead of developing in an exponential manner). The bomb « fizzles ». They call that a « predetonation ».

For an efficient explosion to take place, the radioactive material should be brought together and kept together in a super-critical configuration despite the enormous energy and outwards pressure produced by the first atoms which split, and kept together as long as possible so that as much of the radioactive material as possible undergoes splitting. In practice, figures I read say it happens over a few microseconds.

It all goes very quickly. I also read that « efficient » explosions need some 3 times the critical mass of radioactive matter to be held together as long as is possible (strong [supercriticality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass)).

Both the gun type and the implosion type technologies to trigger and sustain nuclear bomb explosions aim at achieving this strong-supercriticality. But the gun type technology is much slower in bringing radioactive material together compared to the implosion technology.

Now the comparison of [Uranium-235](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-235) and [Plutonium-239](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium-239).

Pu-239 is always mixed with Pu-240 isotopes. PU-240 isotopes naturally produce more neutrons (decay faster) than either U-235 or Pu-239 . If you used the gun type technology for a plutonium bomb, the small mass of radioactive material would still be traveling towards the big mass of radioactive material in the gun, before the whole assembly reaches a strong supercriticality configuration, that the Pu-240 would release enough neutrons to start the chain reaction. The arrangement of the material would be such that some splitting would occur, enough to release some energy to pull apart the bomb, but not enough for a full-fledged explosion to occur. The overall energy released would produce not much more than a fizzle.

U-235 is « comparatively stable » and allows the small mass inside the barrel of the gun to travel all the way to the end and form a strongly supercritical distribution of radioactive material to undergo significant chain reaction.

Check the Wikipedia articles to compare the basic design of the gun type and the implosion type technologies.
