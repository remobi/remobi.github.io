This is a reading recommendation.

If you think that politics is messy in your country, do read the following narrative. It takes place in Guatemala. It’s gripping.

The friend who brought it to my attention said how strange it was that life seemed to go on somewhat normally when in the country. You can find a lot of material about the Rodrigo Rosenberg case online, including the Youtube video mentioned in this "fiction-like-non-fiction story":

« A Murder Foretold », Unravelling the ultimate political conspiracy, by David Grann in The New Yorker, April 4, 2011 (about 35 pages long).
