title: Light travels infinitely fast

This is about science, information and media. In short: about our modern era. In facebook, a friend posted a link to an article about scientists having supposedly achieved infinite light speed:

[« **Scientists Make Light Travel Infinitely Fast.** A team of scientists is claiming to have achieved the seemingly impossible: it’s managed to create a nanoscale device which allows light to travel infinitely fast. But how the hell did they do it, and what does it mean? »](http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2012/11/scientists-make-light-travel-infinitely-fast/)


Wow! Alpha Centauri, here I come… Or so you would think. Have a look at the article. Here are our comments:

This looks like fun!

Illustration about the difference betwen phase and group velocity: a tsunami. What hits you 3000 km away from the tsunami « source » is not the water from that place (3000 km away) which would have traveled all the distance (that’d be ‘group’), but the variation in local water levels induced by the water ‘wave’ which originated at the source. Similarly, electrons which carry electricity in a wire move slowly (0.00029 m/s in the calculation of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_velocity)) but they react quickly to variation in behavior of their neighbors (creating ‘signals’ which propagate at a speed closer to 300.000 km/s).

Remi, in that case, I don’t fully understand the article. It said the phase (wave) velocity is infinite. Wouldn’t that let you transfer data as fast as you can set up to receive it?

Interesting because we address the question of media coverage of scientific advances. Media report about ‘sexy’ advances, like « light traveling infinitely fast ». But if you go to the source article, it titles « Experimental verification of n=0 structures for visible light ». What we have here are scientists who have measured optical properties in a new material which, according to some current models of optics, should also mean that wave velocity is infinite. But they haven’t measured infinite light velocity. More scientific work is necessary. Of course, the wider media haven’t explained the difference… I would express the opinion that the media have no clue themselves about how misleading they are in reporting the work of the scientists (or they don’t want to know / don’t care because the money they make is in reporting the way they do).

I hope I’m clear. I have to go for now.

Remi, I might understand what you have said: « By some theoretical models of optics, wave velocity should be infinite in this material – but wave velocity hasn’t hasn’t yet been measured. Further, « infinite light velocity » isn’t presumed here. Rather, just the wave aspect of light should travel at infinite velocity. » And, you go on to say, the media reporting conflates everything and says « Light made to travel at infinite velocity ».
It’s amusing and sad, as the reporting is for a « popular science » magazine, intended to inform and make science/technology fun for the lay public, not to confuse everything.

Remi, I am not sure, though, whether you were telling me that infinite wave velocity has not yet been measured, only deductively concluded.

« deductively concluded ». How would you measure infinite values of a physical phenomenon (any idea anyone?) ? I don’t see that trying to do that – measuring an infinite value – makes much praticial sense: you’d rather get interested in phenomena correlated to the « odd » one. Such « odd » phenomena challenge not just our understanding of a physical parameter but – as I see it – the theoretical consistency of whole sub-domains of physics.
