Every day, and despite my best attempts to be selective, my browser fills with articles about the current events in Ukraine and I spend much of it as well as too many hours each night reading and processing text to make sure I get as good a picture of what’s going on as I can. That proves both exhausting and frustrating. This is not all: there’s the constant flow of news, the tension, the messages of support, the small things which can be done remotely, like spreading useful messages or helping people keep a sense of normalcy.

Today again, it’s an effort to get off the hook and work on the present essay. Rather than add to that whirlwind of articles, I decided to list topics one comes across or would do well to keep in mind when informing themselves about the events in Ukraine. These are notes rather than any kind of thought-through paper. You have to do the rest of the thinking. Do ask me questions, send me comments, add to this list to make it both more comprehensive and more accurate. Thank you.

Taking a few step back, it strikes me that the introduction of elections in modern societies and the conjoint and well-meaning objective to keep voters informed gave the apparatus of mass media a blank check. My personal experience of following the events unfolding in Ukraine since November last year tells me that there would be much to say about the deluge bestowed upon us, simple voters. The assertive, authoritative tone with which the majority of articles are written is suspicious, and serves other purposes than simply that of informing. The amount of unabashed speculation is also remarkable. Finally, we read preferably articles that fit our political sensitivity and values, because we don’t look further or, if we do, because it just « costs » so much emotionally to read the other side’s news. But a key to the crisis is precisely the full-fledged information war which is going on. Reading opposing views of the same events and recognizing any merits they have is as important, if not more, than reading only articles that like-minded people read. At the moment, I only wish that the war remained a war of news, and that violence on the ground is minimal. I’m pessimistic though because if not now, then on the longer run, I wonder how peace can be maintained when the pictures built for us and for them are so widely different.

How am I? In Tbilisi and doing well.

How do I feel? Strongly for Euromaidan, but somewhat helpless and disarmed after the recent and second major shift in the crisis. Let me explain those two shifts, and only those.

As I see it, the first shift occurred on November 30th, 2013, when demonstrators who had for a week protested the decision of Ukrainian president V. Yanukovich not to sign an Association Agreement with the EU were violently repressed by the riot police (berkut). The demonstrations were dying down and the authorities could have simply waited for business to go back to normal, but the arbitrary and disproportionate use of force against peaceful demonstrators shocked Ukrainians who started demonstrating in increasing numbers. This movement came to be known as « Euromaidan ». It united Ukrainians for better governance, freedom and security and against corruption and impunity at all levels of government, administrations, society. Western media were slow to pass on the idea that supporters of Euromaidan didn’t want the EU but some values of the EU. The main driver of Euromaidan is Ukrainians. The main weakness of Euromaidan is the lack of experienced political representatives whom they trust. Some would say Euromaidan is over. It’s alive but overshadowed by the events in Crimea.

The second shift is that of the mostly internal matter of Euromaidan morphing into an international crisis opposing Russia and Western countries. Today, the bone of contention is Crimea. While I see opportunities to the shift which took place, I also see major dangers for Ukraine which is becoming the object of discussions on which decisions are imposed rather than a significant party in the decision-making process led by the US, Russia and the EU. And while uniting a majority of Ukrainians against Russians, this international crisis also impedes the necessary radical reforms that the transition government in Kiev seems to be genuine in engaging. Unfortunately, at the local level and out of the spotlight of international media, I’m told by a friend in Lviv that « politicians seem to forget what has happened [on Euromaidan] and continue working in the same manner as they used to – appointing their relatives or people they can get some benefit from at different positions ».

It’s also worth noting how the emergence of an East-West crisis conveniently buries the question of authoritarianism in Ukraine and neighboring countries. I might be biased, but I’m thinking about Russia of course, where the current situation justifies authoritarianism rather than it questions it, in the defense of the country and of fellow « Russian-speakers » in Ukraine against those fascists in Kiev which the West supports unconditionally.

But the worse of all is the prospect of war, and not just an information one. The tension grows. The referendum of March 16th in Crimea is only two days away.

I lived in Ukraine, I miss Ukraine and I’m attached to Ukraine in a way that I don’t fully understand myself. Ukrainians could live much better: I see a huge economic potential in their country. If the roads are bad in Ukraine, it’s not because they don’t know how to build them but because no money was invested in them. This is what many Ukrainians would like to see change, but neighboring powers seem not to want to let their country go that way. For Ukraine to choose a future of its own would require a timely congruence of internal and external factors: bridging the gap between the aspirations of the population and their political representatives (trust, governance), and lifting some of the pressures on Ukraine from the West and from the East.

I have friends everywhere in Ukraine. One of them is in Crimea, and today, I hope he’s safe.

*Check-list*
------------
As I mention above, this is a personal snapshot of topics I came across while reading about the current events in Ukraine.

**Aid packages**.
Largely secret agreement on December 17th between V. Yanukovich and V. Putin leading to the promise of Russia to lend $15B to Ukraine. Promise of a $15B to Ukraine by the EU in March 2014. What compensations in return for those packages?

**Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU**.
The initial trigger. As of March 2014, there are discussion between the Ukrainian government in Kiev and the EU to sign the political section of the agreement. Interesting to hear that an agreement negotiated under the direction of a deposed government would be signed by the transition government without further scrutiny.

**Berkut**.
The riot police of Ukraine. Dismantled. Apparently reinstated in Crimea by the pro-Russian authorities.

**China**

**Corruption in Ukraine**.
ОБЩАК, БЛАТ, nepotism. The current shift of the crisis to Crimea may give freer hand to local authorities everywhere in Ukraine, because they are less in the spotlight, to go on with corrupt practices. A friend says that this is what is happening in her region.

**Coup**.
Coup in Kiev by fascists and anti-Russian nationalist parties according to pro-Russian supporters, by Russian military and paramilitary forces in Crimea according to pro-Western supporters.

**Crimea**.
The « Autonomous Republic of Crimea » within Ukraine. It’s likely that the invasion of Crimea had been prepared for some time. It’s also likely that pro-Russian elements infiltrated Crimea while the world had its eyes fixed on Sochi and the Olympic Games. Speculation about the outcome: all imaginable outcomes are currently being presented by journalists as probable or even certain. E.g.: « Winning Crimea is loosing Ukraine », etc. If Russia actually had support from most Crimeans, why didn’t it wait for Crimeans to request their annexation to Russia instead of sending obvious military or paramilitary forces there like it did?

**Crimea, city of Sevastopol**.
The future of the Russian Navy base.

**Crimean Tatars**.
Involvement of Turkey? Involvement of the republic of Tatarstan in Russia?

**Democracy**.
Remember that elections, even free ones, are not enough to make and maintain a democracy. Euromaidan: how long can a government stand without acknowledging the demands of it’s people?

**Demonstrators**.
Paid or unpaid? The practice of paying demonstrators is common in Ukraine and Russia.

**Double standards**.
The Western right of interference. V. Putin may be standing out to give a lesson to the West. The visit of the foreign ministers of France, Poland and Germany to president V. Yanukovich on February 20th, 2014. “face-saving” options for V. Putin… or for Western powers?

**European Union**.
Economic crisis in the EU. The means of the EU to support Ukraine. Public opinions in the EU. Elections of the EU parliament in May 2014. How well does the EU understand Ukraine? Is the EU’s thinking about Ukraine just to try to replicate the experience of lifting Poland out of the doldrums?

**Economy and trade**.
Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine and the EU, EU and Russia.

**Extremism, fascism**.
Fascist rhetoric: emphasis on fascism in pro-Russian media. Pro-Maidan supporters also describe the other side as fascists. Extremists on Maidan, extreme right, nationalists, Jews, etc.

**Finance**.
Dire state of Ukraine’s finances. Currency: the grivna (UAH). The grivnas slips against major currencies. Consequences for the country, for the population.

**Gas**.
Customers for Russian gas and stability in Russia. Gas off the coast of Crimea. Gas off the coast of Ukraine. The changing landscape of gas production around the world. The inversion of the flow of gas between Slovakia and Ukraine.

**Geopolitics of Ukraine and Russia**.
Comparisons with Abkhazia and South-Ossetia. History of the border between Ukraine and Russia. Transnistria. Finlandization?

**Geopolitical precedents**.
Russia defending Syria’s sovereignty. China in Siberia in the future? Memorandum on Security Assurances in connection with Ukraine’s accession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1994 in Budapest, agreement giving Ukraine assurances of territorial integrity as it relinquished its nuclear arsenal: what will Iran make out of the current situation? Former minister of foreign affairs of Ukraine Volodymyr Ohryzko (Владимир Огрызко) calls for Ukraine to rebuild a nuclear arsenal. Russia and the no-fly zone in Libya in 2011.

**Information war**.
My take is that Mr Putin is more concerned by what people inside Russia believe than by what outsiders see of the news broadcast by pro-Russian media. From our perspective, the reporting of events is blatantly manipulated by Russia. This would serve the objective of uniting Russians against any rallying of Ukraine to the West. Other internal objectives could be the cohesion and stability of the Russian Federation, the reaffirmation of his power by the president V. Putin, etc.

**Information war, confidential**.
Two confidential diplomatic conversations leaked in all likelihood by Russia (Victoria Nuland & Geoffrey Pyatt, Ashton & Urmas Paet). Intelligence capacity of the Russians. Apparent irrelevance over the course of events.

**Information war, defamation of journalists and politicians**.
Example: an acquaintance of mine, a German political analyst much in view in the current crisis, has had his Wikipedia page changed to report accusations of pedophilia and child pornography trading.

**Languages**.
Languages in which you read news about Ukraine ; read in other languages ; you can’t use Google Translate enough. February 23rd vote at the parliament of Ukraine to repel a controversial language law of 2012 that allowed regions to adopt more than one language for official use. The effect of the vote of Feb 23rd was to instantly ostracize Russian-speaking Ukrainians in Eastern oblasts and Crimea, bringing some of them to ask to be closer to Russia. Reason invoked by V. Putin to control Crimea, in order to defend Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine. This argument could be used by Russia to defend Russian-speaking minorities in other countries around the world.

**Nationality, ethnicity and citizenship**.
Nationality and citizenship were two distinct notions in the Soviet Union. People had the citizenship of the Soviet Union. They also had an official nationality (Ukrainian, Chuvash, Russian, Tatar, Tuvan, etc.). Inhabitants acquired various citizenships at the fall of the Soviet Union. The notion of nationality remained (officially or not in the various post-Soviet countries: I don’t know). As far as I understand, it is that notion of « nationality » which the Western media described as « ethnicity ».

**Nationality (ethnicity) and political affiliation**.
A Ukrainian citizen might be an ethnic Russian but be politically Ukrainian (describe himself as a citizen of Ukraine first). It’s a shortcut to say that ethnic Russians in Crimea must necessarily want Russia over Ukraine. Their political affiliation might depend on considerations of economy, freedom, and other factors. A friend from the region of Donetsk told me that many of her relatives and friends, rather than pro-Russian or for that matter pro-Ukrainian, are politically passive (and focused on the necessities of daily life). The current events might slowly be changing this political apathy.

**NATO**

**Oligarchs**.
Oligarchs in Ukraine. Oligarchs in Russia. Oligarchs in politics. Appointment of oligarchs in Eastern provinces (to defend their assets against Russia and Russian oligarchs?). Collusion between political and business power.

**Orange Revolution**.
Comparisons of Euromaidan with the Orange Revolution quickly faded. Impression of many Ukrainians that the Orange Revolution was a failed one.

**Orthodox church**.
The Orthodox church’s role on Maidan. Patriarchate of Kiev. Patriarchate of Moscow in Ukraine. Condemnation of violence.

**Participation to the political process in Ukraine**.
A better understanding and citizens’ participation to the political process is greatly in need. Eventually, no Ukrainian should say: I don’t care about politics, nothing can be changed. A friend from medium-size town in the East describes the passivity of her family, whose priority is going to work, earning a living, make ends meet.

**People: V. Poutine**.
Speculation about what he thinks, all imaginable realities are being discussed: from stupid to highly intelligent and aware of the crisis. Does he want a stable or an unstable Ukraine? Can he stop his escalation and survive politically? The West is quick to consider Mr. Putin as a one-of-a-kind problem president, but nothing says that other leaders of Russia wouldn’t or won’t act in similar ways. This calls for a deeper understanding of what drives Russia in this crisis. A friend recommends reading the blog of Andrey Illarionov (Илларионов, Андрей Николаевич), a former adviser of V. Putin. Putin’s ratings said to be at an all-time high within Russia.

**People: Yuliya Timoshenko**.
Widely seen as no less corrupt than other Ukrainian politicians. Many also consider her responsible for the failure of the aftermath of the Orange Revolution… which led to the current situation.

**People: V. Yanukovich**.
Speculation about his grasp of the situation. Most agree he’s sly and guided by self-interest. The pictures of his luxurious residence(s) did much to unite Ukrainians and embarrass Russian authorities when trying to defend him. Now in Russia and visibly a puppet of Russia. Yanukovichleaks.

**People of Ukraine, people in Ukraine**.
The people I know are predominantly pro-Euromaidan and pro-Ukraine but my visit to Kiev (early March) was a good reminder that people have a variety of attitudes and opinions. Some are exhausted and stressed, others express fear (for themselves and their families, for the men that might go to war), happiness and hope (that whatever happens, change is on the way and the country is going somewhere), a general indifference to the situation (and a desire to emigrate anywhere as strong as ever, that’s a friend who’s a citizen of the world, the Soviet world, born in a country, raised in a couple others and, today, holding a Ukrainian passport).

**Redrawing borders in Ukraine: consequences**.
A new iron wall to limit emigration or immigration? Displacements of populations? Russia facilitating the attribution of passports to pro-Russian Ukrainians in Ukraine. Crimea. Eastern Ukraine. Odessa and the securing of the shores of the Black Sea by Russia (and reunification with Transnistria?). Impact on business.

**Reforms in Ukraine**.
Inevitable according to some, whether the money comes from Russia, from the West or from International institutions.

**Revolution**.
Closer to the Tahrir model in Egypt (a popular uprising) than the Polish model (where the whole country including the elites embraced change after the collapse of the Soviet Union).

**Russia**.
Russia’s security. Russia’s territorial integrity. Russia’s sphere of influence. Cohesion of the Russian Federation (83 subjects to-date). Russia as a hybrid system that combines elements of authoritarianism and pluralism.  Russia, the traditional Russian state and V. Putin’s regime. Nationalism within Russia.

**Russians**.
Russians supporting V. Putin. Russians opposed to V. Putin on the matter of Ukraine. Russians on Maidan.

**Russia Today**.
English-speaking government-funded media outlet in Russia. Widely seen as pro-Russian. Recent defection of at least two anchors. Could be a game of Russians to trick their international audiences in thinking that journalists have editorial independence. Again, my current view is that the Kremlin is concerned about the perception of the crisis by its citizens inside Russia. What’s on air outside Russia is secondary, and the « editorial independence » of these journalists could well be a way to make a few Westerners doubt.

**Sanctions**

**Social networks**.
Before the era of social networks, you could ignore the political opinion of your neighbor far more easily than today. Paradoxically, the social networks which brought use closer together may have the opposite effect in times of acute political and geopolitical crises like the Ukrainian one, when « friends » of yesterday voice conflicting opinions. This strains that great premise of democracy that you accept to live side by side with people you disagree with (and have discussions, not arguments). Sadly, the democratic debates of the Euromaidan period between friends (Nov-Feb) seem to have recently taken a more radicalized and unpleasant « you’re with us or against us » tone.they also feel less constructive. As my friend Ahmed commented after three years of inconclusive « Arab spring » in Bahrain: you’ve only seen the beginning of it on social networks. It will get ugly.

**Terminology used by journalists**.
« language divide » instead of what many Ukrainians would describe as only « language differences » between East and West of the country.

**Tourism**.
Tourism is essential to the economy of Crimea. A Spanish friend in Chuvashia in Russia says the situation is bad for tourism across Russia as well.

**Transition government in Kiev**.
Russia could have waited for it to split and divide. Instead, the question of Crimea seems to unite many Ukrainians elsewhere in Ukraine. Decentralisation vs. federalism. Disputed legitimacy.

**Trust**.
Trust between Ukrainians and experienced politicians, trust between Ukrainians and inexperienced politicians. A Ukrainian writer, Andrey Kourkof, said that the « leader of Ukraine is supposed to rise in an agreement between parliament and civil society ». John Herbst, 2003-2006 ambassador of the US to Ukraine, explains that people on Maidan understand that all parties have oligarchs in them.

**Ukraine**.
Territorial integrity. Identity: how do you build a nation without nationalism? what kind of nationalism? History: previous invasions and occupations in the history of Ukraine.

**Ukrainians**.
The events have shown that it’s not possible to unite Ukrainians against an political project which is only the EU or only Russia. A friend described Ukrainians as « partisans ». They will bend but not break, and wait for their time to come.

**Ukrainian diaspora**.
They recently created a website to offer their services to the transition authorities. Will these take up the offer?

**Ukrainians and puns**.
We, non-Ukrainian and non-Russian speakers, apparently fail to notice them. йолка (type « йолка майдан » in a search engine) sounds like ёлка (Christmas tree) but specifically refers to the Christmas tree the authorities wanted to make room for on Maidan when they violently repressed the demonstrators on November 30th, 2013. There’s something funny or ironical in it but I forgot what it is.

**Violence**.
There will always be people sympathetic to each side of a violent clash in a way that makes them difficult to bring back together. I have friends who sympathized with the Berkut (Ukrainian riot police) against the pro-Euromaidan demonstrators. Violence: intimidations, physical violence, dubious charges, directed at a group or at individuals.

**War**.
Experience of Ukraine troops acquired during twenty years of peace versus experience of Russian troops hardened during wars in the Caucasus. Mobilization of Ukrainian men, their willingness to defend Ukraine. Civil war: seems an even more remote prospect considering the possibility of an actual war. Do you believe the West will actually go to war with Russia over Ukraine?

*Additions (2014-03-17)*

**Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU**.
(…) The EU’s responsibility in triggering this crisis. The EU’s understanding of how close Ukraine is to Russia and Russia’s perception of its own security.

**Coup**.
(…) The United States on a mission to destabilize Russia.

**Crimea**.
(…) The cost of developing Crimea.

**Finance**.
(…) The state of Russia’s finances. Currency: the ruble (RUB). Foreign investments in Ukraine, in Russia.

**Ukrainians**.
(…) The takeover of Crimea might be uniting Ukrainians elsewhere in Ukraine like never before in the history of the country.
